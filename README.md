<h3>How does the challenge work?</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
In the first 2 weeks, you‚Äôll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. You'll start by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build your first machine learning model.
</p>
<p>
After tackling these core concepts, you‚Äôll be invited to a super fun, beginner-friendly Kaggle machine learning competition to test your knowledge. Through practice, you‚Äôll explore the best ways to use Kaggle as a learning resource and connect with other data scientists.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to attend elective workshops and seminars hosted by data scientists from Google's Developer Experts Program. The challenge kicks off on August 2nd and only requires a Kaggle account.

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div>
    <p><strong>I already have some familiarity with Python and/or Machine Learning.  Can I still join the program?</strong></p>
    <p>Anyone can join!  You‚Äôll get more out of the program if you‚Äôre not a very advanced Python user, or if you are relatively new to machine learning.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the time commitment for the program?</strong></p>
    <p>Assignments should take about 1 hour/day to complete.</p>
    <p><strong>How much is the program?</strong></p>
    <p>Nothing! All you need is a Kaggle account.</p>
    <p><strong>Do I need to bring my own GPU or deep learning workstation?</strong></p>
    <p>No, Kaggle provides free hosted notebooks with access to GPUs and TPUs to complete your data science projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Which courses will I complete?</strong></p>
    <p>As part of the program, you will complete three courses: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning">Intro to Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning">Intermediate Machine Learning</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>During the ML competition part of this program, can I compete with others on a team?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can compete on a team of up to 3 people.</p>
    <p><strong>Will the competition award medals or points?</strong></p>
    <p>No, the competition will not award medals or points. We've removed the pressure of medals and points in hopes of creating a more productive learning experience.</p>
